    <section id="intro">
        <p>I'm an analytical problem-solver with an entrepreneurial vision, currently completing my Bachelor of Commerce degree and preparing to enter the professional world of consulting and risk management.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="who-i-am">
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I've always been drawn to the intersection of structure and creativity. While my formal education has equipped me with analytical frameworks and business principles, it's my diverse experiences that truly define my approach to challenges.</p>
        
        <p>Growing up, I enjoyed competitive sports, classical guitar (reaching Grade 6 AMEB), and directing documentary-style surf films. These seemingly disparate pursuits taught me the value of discipline, artistic expression, and storytelling—skills that continue to inform my professional perspective.</p>
        
        <p>My competitive nature extends beyond traditional sports into e-sports, where the blend of strategic thinking and split-second decision-making mirrors many business environments. This experience, combined with my participation in national and international Future Problem Solving competitions, has honed my ability to perform exceptionally well under pressure.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="what-i-do">
        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I integrate analytical frameworks with creative thinking to solve complex business challenges. Where others might see only numbers or only creative possibilities, I see the valuable interplay between them. This "analytical creativity" enables me to identify opportunities others might miss and develop structured solutions to ambiguous problems.</p>
        
        <p>My early entrepreneurial venture—developing a fashion brand concept from trademarking to manufacturer outreach—gave me practical insight into business development challenges. Though the project didn't reach full fruition, the experience provided valuable lessons in market research, supply chain considerations, and brand positioning.</p>
        
        <p>My time working in a busy bar/restaurant environment taught me the importance of reliability, teamwork, and adaptability. Taking pride in never being late and effectively training new staff members, I learned how theoretical business principles translate to day-to-day operations.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="what-i-value">
        <h2>What I Value</h2>
        <p>I believe in perfectionist dedication—not as an end in itself, but as a commitment to mastery. I'm willing to invest countless hours to build strong foundations and refine my skills, whether in business analysis, creative pursuits, or personal interests like stock and crypto investing.</p>
        
        <p>I value both independence and collaboration, recognizing that different challenges call for different approaches. My experience has shown me that the best solutions often emerge at the intersection of diverse perspectives.</p>
        
        <p>Looking forward, I aspire to financial freedom and location independence—not simply as lifestyle goals, but as enablers of impact and innovation. I see my initial career in consulting or risk management as a pathway to building expertise and networks that will eventually support broader entrepreneurial aspirations.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="beyond-work">
        <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
        <p>My interests span from the analytical to the aesthetic—from following financial markets to appreciating luxury watches and cars. I'm passionate about fitness and health, particularly weight lifting, and follow Formula 1, NBA, and MLB closely.</p>
        
        <p>As a former surf life saver, I maintain a connection to the ocean and the values of community service and preparedness. This experience, like many others in my background, reinforces my belief that diverse experiences create unique perspectives.</p>
        
        <p>I approach both professional challenges and personal interests with the same blend of analytical rigor and creative thinking—always seeking to understand systems deeply while imagining how they might be improved or transformed.</p>
