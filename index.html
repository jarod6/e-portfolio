        <h1>Jarod Tuckwood</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>I'm a recent Bachelor of Commerce graduate with a passion for analytical problem-solving and entrepreneurial thinking. Currently, I'm exploring opportunities in consulting and risk management while building my understanding of how structured analysis and creative approaches can work together to solve complex business challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Professional Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>My professional accomplishments include competing nationally and internationally in Future Problem Solving competitions, where I developed skills in breaking down complex scenarios and developing innovative solutions under pressure. I've also explored entrepreneurship through a fashion brand concept project, taking it from initial idea through market research, trademark registration, and supply chain exploration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>What drives me is the belief that the best solutions emerge when you combine rigorous analytical frameworks with creative thinking—what I call "analytical creativity." I'm committed to continuous learning and bringing a perfectionist dedication to everything I undertake, whether that's mastering classical guitar (Grade 6 AMEB), directing documentary films, or analyzing investment opportunities in stocks and cryptocurrency.</p>
        
        <p>My values center around excellence, authenticity, and the pursuit of both analytical rigor and creative innovation. These inform my career by driving me to seek roles where I can apply structured thinking while remaining open to unconventional approaches—ultimately building toward my longer-term entrepreneurial aspirations where I can achieve financial freedom, location independence, and the ability to live life on my own terms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm deeply competitive. I've spent years in competitive sports, e-sports, and problem-solving competitions, which taught me how to perform under pressure and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. I'm passionate about Formula 1, NBA and MLB, fitness and weightlifting, and I have a keen interest in luxury brands—from fashion to watches to cars.</p>
        
        <p>I also work as a surf life saver and have experience in high-volume restaurant environments, where I've learned the value of teamwork and maintaining high standards in fast-paced settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Personal Note</h2>
        <p>I'm someone who believes in trusting my vision and opinion of what's good, spending countless hours trying to replicate excellence and fine-tune my foundations. I enjoy working independently but collaborate well in teams, and I never struggle to get along with others.</p>
        
        <p>While I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up professionally, I know that I want to someday have the freedom to live how I'd like, not conforming to what I "must" do to survive. This drive for autonomy and excellence shapes everything I do.</p>
